// An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
// Given an integer n, return the nth ugly number.
// Explanation: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12] is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
// Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
// Output for the first case 12
// Output for the second case 1

#include <vector>
