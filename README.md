# BugBashChallenge

Welcome to the BugBashChallenge event! This coding challenge consists of two exciting rounds: DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) and Debugging. Participants can use Java, Python, or C++ to solve the challenges.

## Event Overview

### Rounds
1. **DSA Round:**
   - In this round, participants will be presented with a set of algorithmic problems that test their skills in data structures and algorithms.
   - Participants can choose to solve problems using Java, Python, or C++.
   - Make sure to follow the input and output specifications provided for each problem.

2. **Debugging Round:**
   - The debugging round focuses on identifying and fixing bugs in given code snippets.
   - Participants will need to carefully analyze the provided code and correct any errors or logical issues.
   - Again, participants can use Java, Python, or C++ for debugging tasks.

### Languages
Participants are allowed to use one of the following programming languages:
- Java
- Python
- C++

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Familiarize yourself with the syntax and standard libraries of Java, Python, or C++.
